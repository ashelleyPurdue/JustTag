The general format is this: "FileName [tag1 tag2 tag3].extension"

The area between '[' and ']' is called the tag area.  The rest of the filename
is called the name.

The tag area can appear anywhere in the filename, even in the middle!  For example:

    hello[foo bar]world.txt

This is a valid place for the tag area.  The tags are "foo" and "bar", and the
name is "helloworld.txt"

There can only be one tag area in any filename.  If there appears to be more
than one, only the first will be looked at.  For example:

    [foo]multiple_tag_areas[bar].txt

In this example, "foo" is the only tag, and the rest of the name is
"multiple_tag_areas[bar].txt".
